      GoodGang Labs is a web3 metaverse startup dedicated to building the
      next-generation communication platform and technology for avatars. We are
      a tight-knit group of creative experts driven to achieve our goal of
      natural and expressive 3D avatar interactions.
      <br />
      <br />
      The seasoned founders of GoodGang Labs bring their diverse set of
      technical, managerial, and developmental expertise gained from companies
      like Meta, Naver, Line, and Snow. Our creative engineers, artists, and
      product managers from multicultural backgrounds established an environment
      where we let new ideas flourish, and iterate quickly and effectively to
      keep building upon our achievements.
      <br />
      <br />
      We believe that avatar communication holds the key to the future of the
      metaverse. One of the challenges in developing effective metaverse
      communication is how freely you can express yourself through avatars.
      Because much of real-life interactions are non-verbal, capturing and
      conveying subtle facial expressions, gestures, and intonations are more
      important than ever before.
      <br />
      <br />
      We are set to address this challenge by developing a core technology that
      allows us to accurately capture the non-verbal elements of communication,
      and deliver them dynamically and expressively through our avatars. We do
      this by integrating our cutting-edge AI video and audio technology with
      our masterfully crafted 3D avatars and presenting them in a platform that
      is both immersive, inviting, and captivatingâ€”something that traditional
      text, audio, and video chats simply cannot emulate. With our platform and
      avatars, you can enjoy these beautiful results while simultaneously
      minimizing your risks of privacy and data safety.
